here's how you can add the **"Using Docker Compose"** section with the `docker compose up -d` command to your `README.md`:


## Using Docker Compose

to start the entire app with all services running in the background, use:

```bash
docker compose up -d
````

this will:

* build the images if they donâ€™t exist
* start the frontend, backend, and mongodb containers
* run everything in detached mode (so your terminal stays clean)

to check if all containers are up:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

to see logs from all services:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

to stop everything:

```bash
docker compose down
```
